### The Sun of Enlightenment Rises

The Buddha had withstood the worst attacks of Mara. Finally, the Evil One
retreated and the terrible storm Mara had raised died away. Now the mind of the
Blessed One relaxed into peace. The great darkness faded away and the full moon
and stars reappeared again.

The Buddha passed into a deep meditation, passing beyond the limits of ordinary
human understanding, seeing the world as it is, and not as it appears to be.
Like an eagle soaring effortlessly toward the sun, his mind moved swiftly onward
and upward.

He saw his past lives and all his former births, with their good and evil deeds,
with their gains and losses. As his mind soared upwards he saw the round of
birth and death of all mankind. He saw beings born repeatedly and dying
according to their karma.

Those who do good actions have heavenly births. Though these lives last longer
than those on earth they also end in death, as they are also subject to the law
of impermanence. Those who were suffering in the hell realms would also continue
in the round of rebirths. So all beings (except Buddhas) are caught in the same
round of existence, due to ignorance.

As his vision became even clearer, he saw the so-called soul of man, which man
claims as his own, broken up into parts and laid before him like the unwoven
threads of a garment. He saw the cause of the chain of existence — ignorance.
The ignorant person, who clings to things that are worthless and transient,
creates in him or herself more and more dangerous illusions. But when desire
dies, illusions end, and ignorance vanishes like the night. Then the sun of
enlightenment shines.

And having understood the world as it is, the Buddha was perfected in wisdom,
never to be born again. Craving and destructive desire had been completely
eradicated — as a fire goes out for lack of fuel.

Bathed in the brilliant light of all wisdom and truth sat the Buddha, the
Perfect One. And all about him the world lay calm and bright and a soft breeze
lifted the leaves of the bodhi tree.

Filled with compassion, the Lord sat beneath the tree in deep contemplation of
the Dharma, residing in the perfect peace of nirvana.

At the dawn after his enlightenment the Buddha uttered this verse:

“Thro’ many a birth in samsara wandered Seeking, but not finding, the builder of
this house. Sorrowful is repeated birth. House builder, thou art seen. Thou
shalt build no house again. All thy rafters are broken; thy ridgepole is
shattered. The mind attains the unconditioned. Achieved is the end of craving.”
