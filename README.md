# Life of the Blessed One

## The Golden Bowl

Now at the time, in a nearby village called Senani, there lived a young, very
beautiful and rich girl called Sujata, who wanted a husband of equal rank and a
son. She had waited for many years and she was not successful. The people told
her that she must go to certain banyan tree near the Neranjara river and pray to
the tree-god to give her a husband and son. She did as the people told her and
later on she got married to a young man and they had a lovely son. She was
extremely happy and decided to fulfil her vow to the tree-god for giving her all
that she had asked for.

Sujata had a thousand cows, and she fed them with sweet creepers called valmee
so that the cow’s milk was sweet. She milked these thousand cows and fed that
milk to five hundred cows, and then fed their milk to two hundred and fifty cows
and so on until she fed only eight cows. She did this to get the sweetest and
most nourishing milk, to make delicious milk-rice as an offering to the
tree-god.

As she was doing this she was surprised to see her servant running back from
cleaning and preparing the area at the foot of the banyan tree. Very happy and
excited, the servant said, “My lady Sujata! The banyan god is meditating at the
foot of the tree. How lucky you must be to have the god in person to accept your
food.”

Sujata too was happy and excited and danced with joy with the servant. They then
took even more pains to prepare the milk-rice, pouring it into a golden bowl.

Taking the delicious milk-rice both of them went to the banyan tree and Sujata
saw what she perceived to be a holy man. He was handsome and golden looking and
sat serenely in meditation. She did not know that he was in fact Ascetic Gotama.
She bowed with respect and said, “Lord, accept my donation of milk-rice. May you
be successful in obtaining your wishes as I have been.”

Ascetic Gotama ate the sweet thick milk-rice and then bathed in the river
Neranjara. This was the last food and bath he would have for seven weeks. When
he finished he took the golden bowl and threw it in the river, saying, “If I am
to succeed in becoming a Buddha today, let this bowl go upstream, but if not,
let it go downstream.” The golden bowl went upstream, all the while keeping in
the middle of the river.

## Striving for enlightenment

In the evening after Sujata’s lovely meal, Gotama went to Gaya and looked for a
suitable place to sit down and meditate. He found a banyan tree and sat on its
east side, the side that was believed to be stable and free from trembles and
quakes. After sitting cross-legged with his back towards the tree, he made this
resolution: “Though my skin, my nerves and my bones shall waste away and my life
blood go dry, I will not leave this seat until I have attained the highest
wisdom, called supreme enlightenment, that leads to everlasting happiness.”

He meditated on his breathing in and breathing out. It was the eve of the full
moon. During the first part of the night many evil thoughts, described as being
like the evil god Mara and his army, crept into his mind. Thoughts of desire,
craving, fear and attachment arose, yet Gotama did not allow these thoughts to
disturb his concentration. He sat more firm than ever. He began to feel calm and
brave as he let these thoughts go and so, in the first part of the night, he
found the power of seeing his own past lives.

In the second part of the night Gotama realised the impermanence of life and how
living beings die only to be reborn again. In the third part of the night he
realised the cause of all evil and suffering and how to be released from it. He
understood how to end sorrow, unhappiness, suffering, old age and death.

### The Sun of Enlightenment Rises

The Buddha had withstood the worst attacks of Mara. Finally, the Evil One
retreated and the terrible storm he had raised died away. Now the mind of the
Blessed One relaxed into peace. The great darkness faded away and the full moon
and stars reappeared again.

The Lord passed into a deep meditation, passing beyond the limits of ordinary
human understanding, seeing the world as it is, and not as it appears to be.
Like an eagle soaring effortlessly toward the sun, his mind moved swiftly onward
and upward.

He saw his past lives and all his former births, with their good and evil deeds,
with their gains and losses. As his mind soared upwards he saw the round of
birth and death of all mankind. He saw beings born repeatedly and dying
according to their karma.

Those who do good actions have heavenly births. Though these lives last longer
than those on earth they also end in death, as they are also subject to the law
of impermanence. Those who were suffering in the hell realms would also continue
in the round of rebirths. So all beings (except Buddhas) are caught in the same
round of existence, due to ignorance.

As his vision became even clearer, he saw the so-called soul of man, which man
claims as his own, broken up into parts and laid before him like the unwoven
threads of a garment. He saw the cause of the chain of existence — ignorance.
The ignorant person, who clings to things that are worthless and transient,
creates in him or herself more and more dangerous illusions. But when desire
dies, illusions end, and ignorance vanishes like the night. Then the sun of
enlightenment shines.

And having understood the world as it is, the Buddha was perfected in wisdom,
never to be born again. Craving and destructive desire had been completely
eradicated — as a fire goes out for lack of fuel.

Bathed in the brilliant light of all wisdom and truth sat the Buddha, the
Perfect One. And all about him the world lay calm and bright and a soft breeze
lifted the leaves of the bodhi tree.

Filled with compassion, the Lord sat beneath the tree in deep contemplation of
the Dharma, residing in the perfect peace of nirvana.

At the dawn after his enlightenment the Buddha uttered this verse:

“Thro’ many a birth in samsara wandered Seeking, but not finding, the builder of
this house. Sorrowful is repeated birth. House builder, thou art seen. Thou
shalt build no house again. All thy rafters are broken; thy ridgepole is
shattered. The mind attains the unconditioned. Achieved is the end of craving.”
